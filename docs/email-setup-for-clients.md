# Setting Up Email for Your Website Contact Form

This guide will help you set up your Gmail account so your website can send emails when people fill out the contact form.

## What You'll Need

- A Gmail account
- Your phone (for security setup)
- About 10 minutes

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Make Your Gmail More Secure

1. Open Gmail and click on your profile picture (top right)
2. Click "Manage your Google Account"
3. Click "Security" on the left side
4. Find "2-Step Verification" and click on it
5. Click "Get Started" and follow the instructions
   - You'll need to enter your phone number
   - Google will send you a code
   - Enter the code to confirm

### Step 2: Create a Special Password for Your Website

Now we need to create a special password that only your website will use:

1. Go back to the Security page
2. In the search box at the top, type "app passwords" and press Enter
3. Click on "App passwords"
4. Where it says "Select app", choose "Mail"
5. Where it says "Select device", choose "Other"
6. Type in "My Website" and click "Generate"

**IMPORTANT**: You'll see a 16-character password like this: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`

### Step 3: Save Your Password

⚠️ **Write down this password immediately!** You won't be able to see it again.

Copy this information and send it to your web developer:

```
My Gmail: [your-email@gmail.com]
App Password: [the 16-character password]
Where I want to receive form submissions: [your-business-email@example.com]
```

## What Happens Next?

When someone fills out your contact form:

1. They'll receive a confirmation email saying "Thanks for contacting us"
2. You'll receive their message with all their details
3. You can reply directly from your email

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes! The app password only allows sending emails. It can't read your emails or access your account.

**Q: What if I forget the password?**
A: No problem! You can create a new one anytime by following Step 2 again.

**Q: Can I use my regular Gmail password?**
A: No, Google requires this special app password for security reasons.

**Q: What if I don't want to use Gmail?**
A: We can use other email services (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) but Gmail is the easiest to set up.
